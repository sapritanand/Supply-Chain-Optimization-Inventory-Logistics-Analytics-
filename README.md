# Advanced Supply Chain Optimization with Python and PuLP

This project showcases the application of advanced optimization techniques using Python and the PuLP library to solve a complex supply chain network problem.

**Problem:**

The project addresses the challenge of minimizing total transportation costs within a multi-echelon supply chain network, while satisfying supply and demand constraints. The model considers:

* **Multiple Warehouses and Stores:** A network of warehouses with varying supply capacities and stores with distinct demand requirements.
* **Heterogeneous Transportation Costs:** A cost matrix reflecting the diverse costs associated with shipping between different warehouse-store pairs.
* **Capacity Constraints:** Limitations on the amount of goods that can be shipped from each warehouse.
* **Demand Satisfaction:** Ensuring that the demand of each store is fully met.

**Solution:**

Leveraging the power of Linear Programming (LP), the project utilizes the PuLP library to formulate and solve the optimization problem. The solution provides:

* **Optimal Shipment Allocation:** A detailed plan specifying the optimal quantity of goods to be shipped from each warehouse to each store, minimizing overall transportation costs.
* **Cost Minimization:** The achieved minimum total transportation cost.
* **Network Visualization:** An interactive network graph illustrating the flow of goods within the supply chain, highlighting optimal shipment routes and quantities.
* **Cost Heatmap:** A heatmap visualization providing insights into the transportation cost landscape, facilitating strategic decision-making.
* **Shipment Distribution Analysis:** A comprehensive bar chart depicting the distribution of shipments from warehouses to stores, enabling the identification of key supply-demand patterns.

**Key Features:**

* **Advanced Optimization Modeling:** Utilizes PuLP to formulate and solve a complex LP model, incorporating multiple constraints and variables.
* **Data Handling and Manipulation:** Employs pandas DataFrames for efficient data management and manipulation.
* **Interactive Network Visualization:** Leverages NetworkX to create an interactive visualization of the supply chain network, enhancing user understanding.
* **Cost Visualization:** Uses Seaborn to generate a heatmap visualization of transportation costs, aiding in cost analysis and optimization.
* **Shipment Distribution Visualization:** Employs Seaborn to create a bar chart illustrating shipment distribution patterns, providing valuable insights.

**How to Use:**

1. Install the necessary libraries: `pip install pulp pandas networkx matplotlib numpy seaborn`
2. Execute the Python code within a Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab environment.
3. Analyze the generated results, including the optimal shipment plan, total transportation cost, and visualizations.

**Potential Extensions:**

* **Integration of Stochasticity:** Introduce stochastic elements to model real-world uncertainties in demand and supply.
* **Multi-Period Optimization:** Extend the model to optimize shipments over multiple time periods, incorporating inventory management considerations.
* **Multi-Product Optimization:** Enhance the model to handle multiple products with varying characteristics and demand patterns.
* **Real-World Data Integration:** Apply the model to real-world supply chain data for practical insights and decision support.
